        "question": "Is it okay to be angry?",
        "answer": "↗ Direct Answer\nYes, anger itself isn't sinful - even Jesus got angry (Mark 3:5, John 2:15).\n\n↗ Supporting Scripture\nEphesians 4:26 - \"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger.\"\n\n↗ Brief Explanation\nThis shows anger can be righteous when directed at injustice or sin. The key is not letting anger control you or lead to harmful actions."
