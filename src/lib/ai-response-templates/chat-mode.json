      "question": "Why did Jesus weep?",
      "answer": "Jesus wept in John 11:35 when He saw Mary and others mourning Lazarus' death. Even though He knew He would raise Lazarus, Jesus felt genuine compassion for their pain. This shows His full humanity - He experienced real emotions and empathy. His tears remind us that God understands our grief and suffers with us. Even in our darkest moments, we have a Savior who truly knows what it feels like to hurt.",
