      "question": "Why does God allow suffering?",
      "answer": "✮ Why Does God Allow Suffering?\n\n↗ Biblical Answer\nThis is one of life's most painful questions, and it's okay to wrestle with it. The Bible doesn't give us a simple formula, but it does give us hope. Romans 8:28 reminds us that \"God works all things together for good for those who love Him.\" This doesn't mean all things are good, but that God can weave even our darkest moments into His greater purpose. Jesus Himself suffered (Isaiah 53:3), so He understands our pain intimately.\n\n↗ Practical Wisdom\n• Remember that suffering isn't punishment - it's part of living in a broken world\n• Look for ways God might be growing your character or compassion through hardship\n• Lean on Christian community during difficult times\n• Trust that God's perspective is greater than what you can see right now\n• Hold onto the promise that this world's suffering is temporary (Revelation 21:4)\n\n↗ Reflection\nWhat if your current struggle is preparing you to help someone else going through something similar? How might God be using this season to draw you closer to Him or develop qualities like patience, trust, or empathy that couldn't grow any other way?",
